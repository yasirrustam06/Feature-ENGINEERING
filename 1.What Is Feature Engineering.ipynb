    "Before we can talk about feature engineering, we have to define what we mean by ‘features’. A feature is a measurable property in a dataset, and a feature can be used as an input to a machine learning model. One way to think about features is as predictor variables that go into a model to predict the outcome variable. For example, if we want a model that predicts precipitation at a given place and time, we might use temperature, humidity, month, altitude, etc. as inputs. These are our features."

Similarly, in large datasets, there might be too many features to manually decide which features to use. Some features might be highly correlated with one another, some might not vary much with the outcome variable, and some might be in the wrong form to be a model input and so on. It is not uncommon that a data scientist might not realize any of this until they begin diagnosing a model that is performing poorly."

For instance, a hundred-feature problem can be reduced to less than ten modified features, saving a lot of computational time and resources while maintaining or even improving performance. Typically, dimensionality reduction methods are machine learning algorithms themselves, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), etc.\n",

However, these mathematical objects are often difficult to interpret. The lack of interpretability is one of the drawbacks of dimensionality reduction."
