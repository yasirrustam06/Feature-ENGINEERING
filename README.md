# `what is Feature Engineering ? `
Feature engineering is the process of selecting, manipulating, and transforming raw data into features that can be used in supervised learning. In order to make machine learning work well on new tasks, it might be necessary to design and train better features. As you may know, a “feature” is any measurable input that can be used in a predictive model — it could be the color of an object or the sound of someone’s voice. Feature engineering, in simple terms, is the act of converting raw observations into desired features using statistical or machine learning approaches
